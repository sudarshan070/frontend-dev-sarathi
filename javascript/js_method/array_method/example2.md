1. Find the sum of all elements/numbers of a given array?
```js
let arr = [2,5,3,2,5]
// 1. using array reduce() method
// 2.  using loops (for loop and for in)
// your code goes here 
```   

2. Copy and sort array.
```js
let arr = ["HTML", "JavaScript", "CSS"];
// your code goes here
```

3. find even number from an array
```js
let numbers = [1, 12, 4, 18, 9, 7, 11, 3, 101, 5, 6];
// 1. using filter method
// 2. using function (loop)
// your code goes here
```

4.  Check if all the numbers in numbers array are divisible by three use array method (every)
```js
let numbers = [1, 12, 4, 18, 9, 7, 11, 3, 101, 5, 6];
// your code goes here
```

5. Make a subset of numbers array [18,9,7,11]
```js
let number = [12, 23, 18, 9, 7, 11, 34, 55]
// your code goes here 
```

6. Returns every element of given array by multiplying it by 3.
```js
let number = [12, 23, 18, 9, 7, 11, 34, 55]
// your code goes here 
```

7. Returns a square of every element of given array
```js
let num = [2, 3, 4, 5]
// your code goes here 
```

8. Merge three array
```js
let arr1 = [1, 2, 3]
let arr2 = [4, 5, 6]
let arr3 = [7, 8, 9]
// your code goes here 
```

9. Find nearest number of 100 in given array.
```js
let number = [12, 23, 18, 9, 7, 11, 34, 55]
// your code goes here
```

10. Concat the array
```js
let arr [1,2,3,[4,5,6]]
// your code goes here
```
